# CDDA_Book_Fragments
Adds fragments of books to foraging and crafting recipes for all skill books in the game to allow for all recipes to be obtainable in a wilderness survival game. Also useful for long term gameplay by promoting the utilization of foraging for getting hard to aquire books.

Basic design principle:
  1. Torn pages for each skill are found by foraging. These have a very low chance of being found in order to balance the addition. These are able to be found during all seasons as well since they have a low chance, and promotes foraging even in winter.
  2. Books become craftable once you have obtained the maximum level the book allows, so this is only useful for getting recipes.
  3. Once you have obtained the correct skill level, and 10 x the skill level in torn pages, you can craft the book with (2 + skill level) * 10 thread (or equivalent), 2 leather patches, and the afformentioned torn pages.
